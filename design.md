## 1. **Layout & Spacing**

1. Use a consistent spacing scale (e.g., 4px/8px).
2. Group related items closer; separate unrelated with more space.
3. Maintain consistent vertical and horizontal rhythm.
4. Keep consistent spacing between headings, content, and sections.
5. Don’t let text or elements touch container edges — add padding.
6. Ensure consistent spacing inside components (buttons, cards, modals).
7. Maintain consistent padding between labels and inputs.
8. Keep list/table row padding uniform.
9. Provide consistent gaps between form fields.
10. Avoid overcrowding with too many elements side by side.

## 2. **Typography**

11. Stick to one typeface with limited weights (2–3 max: regular, medium, bold).
12. Define a clear type scale (e.g., 14, 16, 20, 24, 32).
13. Maintain consistent heading–body ratios.
14. Use hierarchy via size, weight, and color — not just size alone.
15. Avoid overly thin or bold weights everywhere.
16. Keep line-height comfortable (1.4–1.6 for body, balanced in buttons/labels).
17. Limit line length (\~45–75 characters for body).
18. Avoid all-caps for long text; reserve for short labels.
19. Stick to consistent capitalization (prefer Sentence case).
20. Don’t overuse italics or multiple text colors.
21. Ensure secondary text looks clearly secondary (lighter/dimmer/smaller).
22. Prevent walls of equal-weight text — add hierarchy.

---

## 3. **Color & Contrast**

23. Limit palette; derive shades from base colors.
24. Use neutral grays for backgrounds; let accents pop.
25. Avoid too many grays on the same screen.
26. Ensure text/background contrast meets accessibility.
27. Don’t rely on color alone for meaning (add text/icons).
28. Avoid low-contrast text on colored backgrounds.
29. Use consistent, minimal background colors (2–3 max).
30. Use gradients/overlays sparingly and only for clarity (e.g., text legibility).
31. Avoid decorative patterns or accents without purpose.

---

## 4. **Visual Hierarchy**

32. Make one clear primary action; secondary actions muted.
33. Avoid competing CTAs.
34. Reduce visual noise — not everything needs borders/lines.
35. Use whitespace or contrast for grouping before borders.
36. Make secondary text/action clearly subordinate.
37. Use visual anchors in complex layouts to guide scanning.

---

## 5. **Alignment & Grids**

38. Align to a grid; avoid eyeballing.
39. Use consistent left/top alignment for lists/forms.
40. Avoid mixing multiple alignment schemes in the same screen.
41. Ensure vertical alignment in rows (icons + text baseline).
42. Keep table/grid columns consistent and aligned.

---

## 6. **Borders, Corners & Shadows**

43. Minimize borders; prefer spacing/contrast.
44. Keep borders subtle and consistent (avoid mixing styles).
45. Avoid overusing dividers.
46. Define a consistent radius scale (small/medium/large).
47. Apply consistent corner radii across related elements.
48. Avoid mixing sharp/rounded/pill shapes without intent.
49. Keep shadow direction consistent (same light source).
50. Use a small elevation scale (none, low, medium, high).
51. Don’t overuse shadows as a crutch.

---

## 7. **Icons & Imagery**

52. Use a consistent icon set (style, stroke weight).
53. Keep icon sizes aligned with text weight/line height.
54. Maintain consistent padding and placement for icons in buttons/inputs.
55. Place icons consistently relative to text (always left or always right).
56. Avoid mixing filled/outlined/rounded styles.
57. Don’t use decorative icons without meaning.
58. Use consistent aspect ratios for media (thumbnails/cards).
59. Crop images to focus on subjects, not background.
60. Prefer rounded avatars or consistent placeholders.

---

## 8. **Buttons & Interactive Elements**

61. Ensure sufficient size (≥44px) and spacing between targets.
62. Keep consistent heights across buttons in the same row.
63. Define clear hierarchy (solid = primary, outline = secondary, muted = tertiary).
64. Disabled buttons should look inactive but legible.
65. Hover/active states should be logical progressions, not totally different.
66. Provide visible focus states (keyboard accessible).
67. Keep padding consistent in text-only vs. icon+text buttons.

---

## 9. **Forms**

68. Place labels close, usually above inputs.
69. Use sentence case and clear labels — avoid placeholders as labels.
70. Make labels clickable for checkboxes/radios.
71. Keep input widths proportional to expected content.
72. Mark required fields clearly (not color-only).
73. Provide inline help/hints (format examples, constraints).
74. Show errors inline and actionable (tell how to fix).
75. Maintain consistent alignment/order of form actions across screens.

---

## 10. **Lists, Tables & Data**

76. Use subtle striping or background shading for readability.
77. Distinguish headers clearly (weight, contrast, or background).
78. Right-align numbers for easy comparison.
79. Ensure consistent column widths across related tables.
80. Avoid uneven row heights unless necessary.

---

## 11. **States & Feedback**

81. Design empty, loading, success, and error states — not just ideal ones.
82. Empty states should guide users with next steps.
83. Loading states: prefer skeletons/progress over spinners alone.
84. Provide immediate feedback on actions (spinners, confirmations).
85. Avoid dead ends — always offer a next action.
86. Errors should be specific and fixable, not vague.

---

## 12. **Motion & Interactivity**

87. Use subtle, consistent motion (200–300ms).
88. Apply the same easing/duration system across UI.
89. Motion should reinforce flow/hierarchy, not distract.
90. Prefer direct manipulation (drag to reorder, click to edit) where possible.

---

## 13. **Systemization & Consistency**

91. Build a reusable style guide (spacing, type, colors, components).
92. Avoid one-off solutions; design scalable rules.
93. Keep heading styles, button variants, and form layouts consistent.
94. Apply consistent capitalization, corner radius, shadow, and padding systems.
95. Don’t mix too many styles (fonts, shadows, borders, colors).
96. Consistency > novelty — polish comes from repetition.

---

## 14. **Responsive & Adaptive Design**

97. Design mobile-first: start simple, enhance progressively.
98. Use fluid layouts (flex/grid) instead of fixed pixels.
99. Define clear breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).
100. Reflow layouts (stack/collapse), don’t just shrink.
101. Prioritize primary actions/details on small screens.
102. Ensure typography scales appropriately with relative units.
